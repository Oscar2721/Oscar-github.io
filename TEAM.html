<h3>The bad situation for them</h3>
<p class="three"><b>Now, they have been disbanded, one reason is because GD joined the army, another reason is internal problems. As far as I know, the earliest TOP drug use history is also the biggest reason. So that now that GD has joined the army, this team cannot be reorganized.</p></b>
