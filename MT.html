	<h1>His life in the Military</h1>
	<p class="one"><b>MT means Military Trianing</b>
    <ul>
    	<li><b>Because there is a military service law in South Korea, men who are in good health before the age of 30 must participate. And GD also temporarily put down music to participate in military training because of this.</li></b>
    	<li><b>But what makes me very funny is that he only came back after 20 months of training. According to reports, he does not seem to honor the military salute. Perhaps this is why China's military parade is more ambitious than South Korea.</b></li>
    	<li><b>During his service, he actually gained 20 pounds. This made me want to laugh.</b></li>
